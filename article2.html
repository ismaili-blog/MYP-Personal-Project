 <h1 class="centered-title"><u>A Brief Description of Ismaili Sects which Emerged between the death of Ismail bin Jafar and the Present</u></h1>

<p>SEVENER: Upon the death of Ismail, there was a group among his followers who believed that Ismail is not dead, but is in Ghayba [deathless concealment], and that during the end times his son, Mohammad Ibn Ismail would return to the Earth as the Mahdi [The Messiah in Islamic Eschatology] and bring about an age of peace and justice. The most well known entity which adhered to this sect were the Qarmatians, infamous in history as those who sacked Makkah and stole the Kabah. It is of note however that the Qarmatians were more akin to a Terrorist Organization then a nation-state relative even to the material conditions in which they existed in and thus cannot be considered to be the face of this sect. Anyhow, this sect is undisputedly extinct, with not even splinter communities existing.</p>
<br>
<p>DRUZE: They do not consider themselves muslims, however they are still a worthy mention here given their roots come from Ismailism. While the religion’s founder is undisputedly Hamza Ibn Ali Ibn Ahmad, Hamza derived legitimacy for his sect through the Fatimid Caliph Al-Hakim. The Druze are a deeply secretive society which don’t allow conversion into or out of the religion, their religion is influenced by various philosophies and religions, including but not limited to gnosticism, catholicism, Neo-Platonism, Pythagoreanism, and Zoroastrianism. They have and are historically persecuted for their beliefs, they reside mostly in Syria, Lebanon and Mandatory Palestine, with large diasporas in Venezuela and the United States</p>
<br>
<p>MUSTA’ALI: The Musta’ali are a sect of Ismailism which consider the Caliph Al-Musta’ali the successor of his father, Caliph  Al-Mustansir Billah. Contrastingly, The Nizari, The largest branch of Ismailism, considered Nizar, The Oldest son of Al-Mustansir. This is the point of divergence between the Nizaris and the Musta’alis. The Mustaali are further divided into Hafizi andTayyibi. The Former school practically died upon the fall of the Fatimids. Almost all present-day Musta’alis are Tayyibi.</p>
<br>
<p>HAFIZI: The Hafiziyyah are a branch of Musta’ali Ismailism. The Tayyibi and the Hafizi are both Musta’ali, however they differentiate on who is the rightful successor of the Caliph Amir bil Ahkam-Allah, the Tayyibis follow At-Tayyib Abu’l Qasim while the Hafizis followed Hafiz. Hafiz would be the winner of the power struggle between him and At-Tayyib, The Hafizis hence remained the school which was inextricably bound to the Fatimid government until its collapse, which lead to the Hafizids decaying into irrelevance and de-facto extinction. </p>
<br>
<p>TAYYIBI: The Tayyibi are the branch of Musta’alism which affirm the Imamate of At-Tayyib Abu Qasim. They don’t differ much in theology from the Hafizi besides the succession issue. In the year of 1592, the Tayyibis divided into two factions over who the 27th Dai-Al-Mutlaq was, Dawood bin Qutubshah or Sulayman bin Hasan, both bohras derive their names from these two men, being the Sulaymani and the Dawoodi. The Alavi Bohra split from the Dawoodi branch after the death of the 28th Dai-Al-Mutlaq, What would be The Alavi Bohra believed in Ali bin Saiyedi Ibraahim, while the Dawoodis believed in Abdul Tayeb Zakiuddin as the successor. The Bohras are the same in terms of fundamental beliefs and all consider themselves to be under the Tayyibi Umbrella<</p>
<br>
<p>NIZARI: The Nizari are the largest and arguably most well known branch of Ismailism, they derive their origins from the succession to Al Mustansir, The Caliph had two sons, Nizar and Musta’ali, the two sects, Nizarism and Musta’alism derive their origins from the two figures mentioned, The Nizaris were persecuted in the subsequent history of the Fatimid Caliphate but prospered after its fall. The Current Ismaili Nizari Imam is Aga Khan IV, The Undisputed Leader of the Nizaris, Aga Khan IV is well known for his charity efforts, particularly through the AKDN (Aga Khan Development Network). The Nizari have unique views in contrast to Twelvers and even their fellow Ismailis, with differences in laws of Marriage, Fasting, the Calendar, etc. </p>
