    <h1 class="centered-title"><u>From Ismail Ibn Jafar to the Origins of the Fatimids: A Brief History of the Ismaili Imams</u></h1>

<p>the issue of the succession to Imam Ja'far Al Sadiq (a) has had a dramatic and immense impact on the shaping of the history and identity of Shia Islam, The Imam had 5 Children, they were:
<br>
<p>Musa Al Kadhim 
<br>
Ismail bin Jafar 
<br>
Abdullah Al-Aftah 
<br>
Ali bin Jafar
<br>
Al-Abbas bin Jafar</p>

Of these five, three of them are of relevance to us.</p>

<p>Upon the death of Imam Jafar, the Shi’ites differed amongst themselves over his succession, the largest group, i.e the ones which affirmed the Imamate of Musa Al Kadhim, were to be known as the Twelvers, the Ithna Ashari. These are the vast majority of all shias today, Another group, which would be known as the Fathiyya, accepted the claim of Abdullah on Imamate in virtue of his seniority (in age) among the progeny of Imam Jafar (a),This sect is now extinct.  and lastly, the Ismailiyah, those who affirmed the Imamate of the late son of Imam Jafar (a), Ismail.</p> 
<p>The Imamate of Ismail (r) is a curious case, as Ismail (r) predeceased his father, and it was unprecedented in the history of Shi’ism, that the heir to the Imam die before the Imam himself, anyhow, there are countless arguments for and against Ismail’s Imamate and that is not the point of the article.</p>

<p>“...the issue became complicated because most historical sources confirm that the Imam Ja‘far al-Sadiq publically designated his son Isma‘il as his successor. But most sources also say that Ismā‘īl died before his father. Therefore, at the death of the Imam Ja‘far al-Ṣādiq, the Shi‘ah community split into a number of factions – each following a different Imam. Many who followed Isma‘il and upheld his Imamat did not believe that Ismā‘īl had actually died, while others affirmed Isma‘il’s death and followed his son Muhammad ib. Ismā‘īl as the Imam.”</p>
<p>-Ismaili Gnosis, Who Succeeded Imam Jafar al-Sadiq? Seven Proofs for the Imamat of Imam Ismail ibn Jafar [1]</p>

<p><i> [1]- This is purely to present the Ismaili view, other sects would likely disagree with the above statement.</i></p>

<p>Muhammad Ibn Ismail. He was the Imam of the Ismailis after the death of Ismail bin Jafar (r). His Imamate was one of Persecution and he was forced to be in a perpetual state of Taqiyah (Religious Dissimulation) , as per the fourth volume of Uyun Akhbar Al Ridha (a), Muhammad spent his days preaching Ismailism in Madinah, his activities aroused the attention of Harun Al Rashid, the Caliph of the Islamic State at the time, however, Muhammad successfully spent his life evading the Caliph’s grasp. He would eventually move to Palmyra in Syria, and then finally to Kufa, where he would die, completing his tenure as the Imam which lasted for around 44 years. </p>
<p>Muhammad can also be attributed with starting what would eventually become a sunnah of the Ismaili Imams, which was using pseudonyms to avoid detection and persecution by authorities. When Muhammad would settle in Palmyra, he would call himself “Maymun Al-Qaddah”, this would cause confusion to such an extent that the 19th Dai Al Mutlaq of the Tayyibi Ismailis writes:</p>
<p>"The da'is used their own names as nick-names for the Imams in order to protect them from persecution; some people were misled by this to such a degree that they said that the descendant of Muhammad ibn Isma'il was Abd Allah ibn Maymun al-Qaddah."</p>
<p>Muhammad Ibn Ismail was succeeded by his son, Abū Aḥmad ʿAbd Allāh ibn Muḥammad ibn Ismāʿīl, Also known as Ahmed Al-Wafi. </p>
<p>Ahmed Al-Wafi was known as Al-Attar during his residencies in Nishapoor and Salamia, Al-Attar, meaning a medicine manufacturer, was a name, which, while not false (He indeed worked in such a position in the aforementioned cities), was a means to hide his true identity, as Imam of the Ismailis, while Ahmad spent most of his Imamate in hiding, he was represented by Abdullah bin Maymun. 
</p>
<p>Upon the death of Caliph Al Amin, Al Mamun took over the Abbasid throne, Mamun moved his operation to the frontier province of Khorasan, and hence had a mild view towards the Shias, however, this changed later into his reign, when his cruelty towards the Alids increased considerably, and thus the Ismailis, and in particular their Imam, Ahmad Al-Wafi, had to practice strict taqiyah, he moved from place to place, used pseudonyms, used representatives, he would settle one day in the village of Ashnash, where he would marry a woman would would give him a son, his birth name was Ahmad, but was changed to Muhammad Taqi, his heir. The Imam would eventually be lost completely to his followers, until a group of them found him in Hims, Syria, he would eventually die there, upon his death, he is reported to have said:
</p>
<p>"I bequeath the office of Imamate to this my beloved son [Muhammad Taqi]. He is your Imam from now onwards. You take an oath of allegiance from him, and must remain faithful with him in the manner you have been with me, and obey his orders."
</p>
<p>And so Ahmed Al-Wafi perished, and Muhammad Taqi became Imam of the Ismailis.</p>
<p>Muhammad Al-Taqi was the second hidden Imam, and the 9th Ismaili Imam in general, he worked as a trader in Salamia, Syria, he was renowned, partly because of his renown as a trader and mostly because of his status as the leader of Ismailis. This had alerted the Syrian Governor, who reported this activity to the Caliph, however, Al-Taqi had fled Salamia before any action could be taken. 
</p>
<p>He is also said to have sanctioned Ismaili Involvement in the Intellectual Golden Age which arose contemporary to Al-Taqi, in particular, Neo-Platonism, which has shaped Ismaili (and the Islamic) Theology immensely.
</p>
<p>He spent most of his tenure in Salamia, from which he sent out missionaries who propagated he Ismaili faith, He is reported to have died in 840 AD, in the city of Salamia, he bequeathed the office of Imamate to Hussain Radi Abdullah, his son.
</p>
<p>Radi Abdullah was the tenth Ismaili Imam and the third hidden Imam, like his predecessor, he spent his Tenure in Salamia, He continued the practice of his predecessor, sending out dais from Salamia to preach Ismailism throughout the Islamic Empire, during his tenure, the Yemen was conquered by a group approved by the Imam and lead by one of his most acclaimed dais, known as Ibn Hawshab, the campaign was a giant success and Ismailism saw itself in a position of rule over a state for the first time in its history. 
</p>
<p>Radi spent the rest of his life peacefully living in Salamia, as his father did, he lived in harmony with the community around him, he had a reputation for generosity, not discriminating between Ismaili or non-Ismaili, he was financially well off, but was humble in his mannerisms and attire. It is reported that his interests were horsing, shooting, hunting and archery, Radi died peacefully in his sleep, before dying, he appointed Muhammad Al-Mahdi as the Imam after him, his son. 
</p>
<p>It has been reported in the Tarikh of Ibn Khaldun that on his deathbed, Radi said to his son:
</p>
<p>"You are the promised Mahdi. You would take refuge in a remote land after my death, where you would have to submit to hard trials." (Tarikh, Karachi, 1966, 5:93).
</p>
<p>Hence ends the Age of the Hidden Imams and the Beginning of the Fatimid Age.</p>
