    <h1 class="centered-title"><u>The Ismaili Creed</u></h1>
    <p>While we know that what differentiates the Ismailis from the rest of Islam is the affirmation of Ismail b. Jafar’s succession to the post of Imamat, They are also different in the sense that their creed is unique and separated from those of the other sects, The Ismails do not consider themselves Mutazila, nor do they consider themselves among the Maturidi and Ashari, nor do they share the traditional creed of the twelvers - that being the Ithna Ashari, the creed which the Ismailis hold, deeply influenced and shaped by Neo-Platonic Philosophy, is completely and utterly unique to them, and that is what makes it so captivating to explore.</p>
    <br>
    <p><i>“[Do] not abhor any science or shun any book, and [do] not be unduly biased against any creed; for our philosophy and creed encompasses all creeds and all knowledge; [for] our creed consists of studying all existing things in their entirety, the physical and the intellectual, from their beginning to their end, their apparent and their hidden, their manifest and their concealed, with the aim to grasp their Truth, with the understanding that they emanate from one source, one cause, one world, [and] one soul, which encompasses their different essences, their diverse species, their various types, and their changing forms.”</i> - Epistles of the Ikhwan Al Safa, one of the most important texts in Ismailism</p>
    <br>
    <p>One of the most fundamental questions to any creed - universal regardless of their sectarian affiliation - is the question of the Quran; was the Quran co-existent and Eternal with God, or was it his creation? How this question is answered has deep implications and can arguably be described as the root by who’s answer the rest of the theological tree is formed. The Ismaili theology can be described as a syncretism between the other creeds in answering this question, The Quran is synonymous to the Speech of God, the Ismaili belief is that the speech of God is an everlasting command which is the embodiment of every existent being, when God wishes to send revelation to one of his prophets, he emanates this “commandment” to the Prophet through his intermediaries - that being the angels Gabriel, Michael and Seraphiel - who represent different aspects of the revelation. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Consequently, the Ismailis believe that the literal words of the Quran are only one of many possible manifestations of the divine word, The Bible and the Torah in its uncorrupted form were also the Quran, though the way they became manifest was different, hence, the Ismailis affirm the Eternity of the Quran, but they affirm its message purely, but they do not do the same for the “Book” which is referred to as the Quran. to the ismailis, The Quran - referring to the Essence - is Eternal but the Quran - referring to the Book - is not. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The Ismaili belief is that revelation is received through three means - Divine, Spiritual and nonverbal inspiration [Wahy] and Support [Tayid], The Ismailis affirm the doctrine of “Nur” - In the Alam Al Dhar [and this doctrine is not unique to Ismailis but is affirmed by the Shia in General], which refers to the time prior to the universe’s existence, where there was nothing but God, during this period, God created the soul of all sentient beings, but the souls were not created arbitrarily, but in an order; here is how it went:</p>
    <br>
    <p>First, Prophet Mohammad - the Best of All Men - and his Family; which refers to his daughter, Fatima, her descendants [where this line converges and ends is the topic of debate amongst all shia sects, for now we must only know that her “descendents” refers to the Imams] his son-in-law Ali, and his children - Hassan and Hussain. Prophet Mohammad was made the Greatest of All Lights, and his family, while distinguished from each other in rank, were also made of a Great Light, then followed the Prophets, then the Messengers, then the Saints, and so on and so-forth. The Ismailis - and the shia in general - thus profess the Seniority of the Prophet and his Family above the rest of existence, including the Prophets, which puts them in odds with the Majority Sunni View, that there is no one superior to Mohammad and the rest of the Prophets, in addition, The Ismailis also believe that the Prophets and the Imams are the living embodiment of the Quran - It has been narrated through a variety of sources that Imam Ali had stated: “If you wish to look at the walking Quran, look at me.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>While not at all a complete account of the Ismaili theology - as that is impossible even in an entire volume - The article above gives a valuable, summarized understanding of the Ismaili Creed and is useful highly for those of us who can’t invest the time and effort into traditional sources of information.</p>
