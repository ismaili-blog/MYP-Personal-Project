    <h1 class="centered-title"><u>The States of Ismailism: From the Qarmatians to the Sulayhids</u></h1>
<p>QARMATIANS: The Qarmatians were a militant Isma'ili Shia movement that emerged between the 9th and 10th centurIES, they were primarily centered in al-Hasa, a city in Eastern Arabia and later expanded into Iraq.  The Qarmatians were Fathis, and were thus separated and orchestrated by the Fatimid Caliphate in Egypt - Leader of the Orthodox Ismaili Faction.  the Qarmatians established a state which was unique in the Islamic World, scholars would describe it as the first proto-socialist project in the Middle East before the 20th century [though this is heavily disputed, the Qarmatians were renowned practitioners of chattel slavery] They were also known for their extremist beliefs, rejecting the claims of both the caliph in Cairo and the caliph in Baghdad. The Qarmatians carried out large-scale invasions, notably their invasion of Iraq and their sack of Mecca, characterized by their brutal and destructive actions against the people they conquered, they were reviled during and after their peak, Their activities included raids, sacks and extortion.</p>p>

<p>FATIMIDS: The Fatimids originated as a movement in contemporary Tunisia during the 10th Century when the Abbasid Caliphate showed signs of weakness and decay, they would rapidly expand through Africa, Conquering Egypt then the Levant and Syria and also the Hejaz, this empire would remain strong and a major regional power until their loss in the crusades and the coup by Salah-Ad-Din-Al-Ayyubi. This state is easily the most important and the most significant in shaping the Ismaili Sect, firstly, the Fatimids were the undisputed leaders of Ismaili Orthodoxy, their Caliphs were the Imams and despite branches emerging in lieu of succession crises, every Ismaili Sect respects the Fatimid State in general, the Caliphs of the Fatimid State are believed by the Ismailis to be infallible, to be without fault, and despite sometimes the decisions of caliphs confusing their adherents, they always remained loyal, the only exception within the Ismaili community being, of course, the Fathite Qarmatians, but they could barely be considered Muslim let alone shia or ismaili. The Fatimids are also the founders of the city of Cairo, its foundations were built out of a small town but it expanded quickly into one of the greatest and most prosperous metropolises of the near east. The fatimids are also known to have send Ismaili missionaries [i.e Dais] throughout the Ismaili world, Including Abbasid Territory in order to gain more followers, it had even got to a point that the Dais were causing such social unrest within Iraq that the Caliph gathered the scholars of various creeds within Islam, including Twelvers and Sunnis, and demanded them to draft a resolution which condemned Ismailism and the Fatimid Claim to Caliphate, this state overall was very influential in Islamic History, but its significance to the Ismailis cannot be understated. </p>

<p>ALAMUT: The Alamut State was a significant Ismaili principality which emerged in the Alamut region of Iran. Founded by Hassan-i Sabbah in 1090, it served as the headquarters for the Nizari Ismaili Community in Northern Iran, The state gained fame for its strategic mountain fortress, Alamut Castle, their incredible ability and luck to survive in a World which was completely hostile to them [The Seljuks, a mighty empire whose territory they were surrounded by, were always hostile to them, they attempted many times to conquer the Alamut territory, however they would not succeed] The Alamut state is also known for their unique techniques of waging war, not having the resources or the manpower of a conventional state, the Alamut relied in psychological warfare and assassinations - those who carried out these orders would be known as the Hashahsheen - the root of the word “assassin” in English. The Alamut would eventually collapse, however this was not by the hands of their traditional enemy - the seljuks, for they were destroyed by the Mongols and the Alamut would meet the same fate by the same enemy, The Mongols laid a siege on the Alamut Castle until they were forced to capitulate, the Mongols ordered a wholesale slaughter of not only the Ismailis of Alamut Castle but every Ismaili in Iran. this, however, would not kill Ismailism in Iran, and they would continue to have an influence from the shadows.</p>

<p>SULAYHIDS: The Sulayhid Dynasty was established in 1047 by Ali ibn Muhammad al-Sulayhi, the Sulayhids were a significant Isma'ili dynasty that ruled over much of historical Yemen at its zenith. Nominally subject to the Fatimid caliph in Egypt, the Sulayhids played a crucial role in establishing Ismaili influence in Yemen. The dynasty was known for its unique system of maternal succession, which was unlike that of other traditional Islamic Kingdoms and States, The Dynasty reached its pinnacle under Queen Arwa al-Sulayhi, a prominent figure who bequeathed her wealth to the Tayyibi mission upon her death. Despite the Golden Age under Arwa, the Sulayhid Dynasty effectively came to an end with her passing, marking the end of the last Ismaili government in Yemen. The collapse of the Sulayhid Dynasty was influenced by both internal conflicts and external pressures, This project would end in 1138.</p>
